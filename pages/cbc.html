           <h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
           <br>
           <p>In this project, I worked in a group of 4 students, We were tasked with the responsibility of revamping CBC’s website and mobile platforms</p>
           <br>
           <p>Duration: 2-3 weeks</p>
           <br>
           <p>Methodology: We implemented the design thinking methodology to figure out a way to improve the user experience</p>
           <br>
           <p>Steps shown in this case study: Heurestic Evaluation, Usability Tests, White board brainstorming & Findings and final design shown </p>
           <br>
           <h3>Role</h3>
           <p>My role in this project was User Researcher and Wireframe Designer</p>
           <br>
           <h3>Tools Used</h3>
           <p>Figma, Miro, Invision, Google Tools</p>
           <br>
           <h3>Project Duration</h3>
           <p>2–3 weeks</p>
           <br>
           <p>After a brief run through of the website and conducting a detailed heurestic evaluation, here’s what we figured was wrong with the website:</p>
           <br>
           <p>1. Text intensive: Although, this is a news outlet and should be text heavy, the homepage was too overwhelming.</p>
           <p>2. Arrangement of Tiles: Not cohesive and needed to have a flow.</p>
           <p>3. Information architecture: This was a noticeable issue as the nav bar and footer section was crowded and were very repetitive</p>
           <br>
           <h3>Usability Test Findings</h3>
           <br>
           <p>. Navigation Bar</p>
           <p>. Not personalized to the user</p>
           <p>. Location did not appear it could be personalized</p>
           <p>. Dropdown was not as effective, the users scrolled till they found an article that was relevant to them</p>
           <p>. Expected the radio function to be stand-alone and not in the dropdown menu</p>
           <p>. Struggled to find location on mobil app</p>
           <p>. Homepage was overwhelming</p>
           <p>. Radio not visible in mobile</p>
           <p>. Overwhelmed by content on homepage in mobile</p>
           <br>

           <h3>User Persona</h3>
           <br>
           <p>With our user tests, heurestic evaluation and considering the services CBC offer, we came developed a proto persona to humanize our users and help make decisions that would best serve them</p>

           <h3>Addressing the issues</h3>
           <p>Step 1</p>
        <br>
        <p>Information Architecture to tackle the arrangement and placement of important navigations. Also, to address the overwhelming content and highlight the important features like; location, radio service, etc.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Step 2</p>
        <br>
        <p>Colour wheel of the website and mobile were a little dull. Too neutral and does not keep the users engaged. We had a few ideas to play around with some colours from the logo but red was al little harsh. We settled with blue for our potent colour. Red to highlight important things, white and gray as fillers. Here’s our style guide ahowing the colours, buttons we settled with and typography.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Step 3</p>
        <br>
        <p>We conducted another usability test after designing to ensure we addressed the key user barriers. We conducted the 5-Second Usability Test. Below is the transcript</p>

        <p>With our findings, we made the final <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/igdrxGQpk7yIl1QaBv9yhO/CBC-Proto-Persona?page-id=501%3A13447&node-id=771%3A18861&viewport=11%2C690%2C0.06&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=771%3A18861&show-proto-sidebar=1">prototype</a></p>
        
        <br>
        <h3>Lessons/Takeaways</h3>
        <br>
        <p>As I mentioned earlier, we were meant to redesign the website and mobile but we had little to no time to fully develop the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/igdrxGQpk7yIl1QaBv9yhO/CBC-Proto-Persona?page-id=503%3A18197&node-id=503%3A18198&viewport=-30%2C490%2C0.1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=503%3A18198&show-proto-sidebar=1 ">mobile version</a></p>
        <br>
        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <br>
        <p>1. Testings are key when it comes to making design decisions. It helped us design for functionality and not just aesthetics.</p>
        <p>2. Working in a team and highlighting one another’s strengths really helped us divide and conquer. </p>
            Also, it best helps us determine how the informational Architecture should be presented; services & programs that should be highlighted on the website and other categorization. Here are the results we got:</p>
            <br>
        <h3>Future Developments</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Further iterate the mobile version and have more tests on both versions.</p>
