           <h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
           <br>
           <br>
           <h3>The Problem:</h3>
           <p>Navigation bar interaction and homepage organization and categorization are preventing more users and prospective consumers from joining Mennonite</p>
           <br>
           <h3>The Solution</h3>
           <p>Redesign navigation to showcase key paths users visit and re-categorize the homepage to give a good glimpse of Mennonite’s mission and services being offered. In all, provide a better user experience</p>
           <br>
           <h3>Goal</h3>
           <p>On the basis of the above problem and proposed solution, the goal of this project is to improve the user experience for Mennonite New Life Center’s target audience and improve the overall online presence of the organization</p>
           <br>
           <h3>Role</h3>
           <p>My role in this project was Project Coordinator and User Research Lead</p>
           <br>
           <h3>Tools Used</h3>
           <p>Figma, Miro, Invision, Google Tools, Trello & Canva</p>
           <br>
           <h3>Project Duration</h3>
           <p>June 2022, 2–3 weeks</p>
           <br>
           <h3>Methodology</h3>
           <p>At my workflow, we use Design Thinking methodology to find solutions from the user problem. Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that allows one to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test. We also conducted usability tests between the mid fidelity to high fidelity prototypes</p>
           <br>
           <h3>User-focused inspiration/motivation</h3>
           <p>Immigrants make up a majority percentage of the Canadian population and the services Mennonite have been offering since 1983 contribute to the growth of the economy. We believe, helping with the redesign of their website would draw more traffic and aid in the increase in donation and reach to their target audience
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Stage 1: Empathize</h3>
        <p>I want to learn the users’ behaviours, how they think, what they expect and their motivations</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Survey Results</h3>
        <p>We conducted a survey using google forms and sent it to the relevant immigrant facebook groups to get more accurate responses from our potential personas. The purpose of the survey was to better understand the users, make better design decisions, understand their pain points, goals and needs.

            Also, it best helps us determine how the informational Architecture should be presented; services & programs that should be highlighted on the website and other categorization. Here are the results we got:</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
        <p>While waiting on the feedback from the survey, we conducted a heuristic evaluation to figure out the pain points of the users when interacting with Mennonite New Life Center’s current website. Here are the results:</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Usability Tests</h3>
        <p>We conducted a usability test and had 5 participants. We gave them tasks to complete via zoom and below are the insights we got</p>

            <img src="../assets/images/Mennonite - User Interview Insights - Interview notes 1.png" alt="user interview">
        </picture>
        <br>
        <p>Once we analysed the interview transcripts, we made an affinity diagram to better categorize the important sections of the website that need iterations to be seen in the Mid-Fidelity prototype. </p>
        <br>

        </picture>
        <br>
        <p>Then we made an I Like, I wish, What If chart and a Feature priotization matrix to priotize what changes are more important to our users to be iterated to ensure a better user experience. </p>

            <img src="../assets/images/Mennonite - Prioritization Matrix 1.png" alt="prioritization matrix">
        </picture>
        <br>
        <p>With these analysis, we went on to make the iterations and came up with a redesigned prototype, which we then conduscted another usability test to ensure the top insights gotten from our participants, the changes were implemented.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Current Website Usability Test Result</h3>
        <br>
        <p>1. Issue with the tertiary dropdown menu: Hover colour blended in with the background colour, there was no indication that there was a tertiary dropdown for users to explore more landing pages</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>We made the hover colour stand out more by using a shade of green gotten from Mennonite’s brand colours. We also added arrows to indicate there are tertiary drop downs to be explored</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p>2. Donate & Help us fundraise have different landing pages: The dropdown and button for ‘donate’ had different landing pages. This was discovered when a participant clicked on the ‘donate’ menu rather and took them to different pages.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>We combined both pages to allow for less clicks and make the menu bar clean</p>
        <br>

        <h3>High Fidelity Prototype Usability Test Result</h3>
        <br>
        <p>1. Text Style of ‘Our Vision’ was not readable: Some participants mentioned the text style was too cramped and was not as clear.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>We increased the spacing between each lines to allow an easy eye flow when reading for users</p>
        <br>

        </picture>
        <br>
        <p>Button on programs and services page was not clickable: Participants mentioned there was a bug and they were unable to complete the tasks given to them since the button was unresponsive.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>We adjusted the prototype connectors on figma to rectify this issue.</p>
